These are the slips, rolls, and pops from screeners in the pick-and-roll. This is a tricky top-line stat to make judgements based off of due to the variation that exists within it. When analyzing players, I make an effort to look more at the efficiencies at each of those three specific actions. If a player has mediocre roll man numbers but elite popping data, thereâ€™s more value than initially meets the eye.
