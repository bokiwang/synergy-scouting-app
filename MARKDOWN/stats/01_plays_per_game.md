The number of specified play type occurrences per game. NOTE: we decided not to focus on possession count because one possession can consist of many consecutive play types (e.g. a spot up followed by an offensive rebound, followed by an isolation, which evolves into a post up play and ultimately culminates with a made basket). For simplicity, we divided each possession into spliced sequences consisting of one unique play type each.
