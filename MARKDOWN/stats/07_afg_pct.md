Adjusted field goal percentage measures shooting efficiency by taking into account the total points a player produces through their field goal attempts. Its goal is to show what field goal percentage a two-point shooter would have to shoot at to match the output of a player who also shoots three-pointers. Formula: 
$\frac{\frac{1}{2} * (\text{Points} - \text{Free Throws Made})}{\text{Field Goal Attempts}} * 100$
