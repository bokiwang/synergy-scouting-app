| Statistic | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| Plays/Game | The number of specified play type occurrences per game. NOTE: we decided not to focus on possession count because one possession can consist of many consecutive play types (e.g. a spot up followed by an offensive rebound, followed by an isolation, which evolves into a post up play and ultimately culminates with a made basket). For simplicity, we divided each possession into spliced sequences consisting of one unique play type each. |
| Points | Points per game. |
| PPP | Points per possession. |
| FGM | Field goals made. This statistic includes both 2PT and 3PT baskets. |
| FGA | Field goals attempted. This statistic includes 2PT and 3PT makes and misses. |
| FG% | Field goal percentage. Formula: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\text{Field Goals Made}}{\text{Field Goals Made} + \text{Field Goals Attempted}} * 100"> |
| aFG% | Adjusted field goal percentage measures shooting efficiency by taking into account the total points a player produces through their field goal attempts. Its goal is to show what field goal percentage a two-point shooter would have to shoot at to match the output of a player who also shoots three-pointers. Formula: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\frac{1}{2} * (\text{Points} - \text{Free Throws Made})}{\text{Field Goal Attempts}} * 100"><br/><small><i>References:</i> <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_field_goal_percentage'>Wikipedia: Effective Field Goal Percentage</a> & <a href='https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html'>Basketball Reference Glossary</a></small> |
| TO% | Turnover rate. The percentage of plays that resulted in the other team gaining possession before a shot was attempted. |
