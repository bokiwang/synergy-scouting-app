 Transition possessions are about the defense not being set, and don’t have anything to do with the time left on the shot clock. That means there’s no time cutoff that makes a possession a halfcourt possession rather than a transition possession. On a more granular level we can look deeper into the role a player had within a transition possession. That can be as a leak-out man, the ball-handler, left/right wing, or a trailer.
