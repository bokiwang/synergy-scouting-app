I don’t think I need to explain isolation, but I will say one thing: If one of these other actions occurs and is broken, it may end up being logged as an isolation possession. For example, if a pick-and-roll ball handler dribbles off of the screen and needs to retreat dribble twice, then attacks after that substantial delay, it’s an iso possession. A spot up possession where the player catches then does several jabs or tries to size up his defender is now an isolation possession.
